reactphp-curl
===============

## Modification
This is a fork of the work from [KhristenkoYura/reactphp-curl](https://github.com/KhristenkoYura/reactphp-curl). Thanks Khristenko!

I wanted to have the client class attributes not public, which would break other people's code using the original library, hence the fork. 

## Install

The recommended way to install reactphp-curl is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```
{
    "require": {
        "khr/react-curl": "*"
    }
}
```
